<p> Fundamentally a programming language solves the problem of ease of expression for a computing machine to get us derived result. 
In the process of solving this there are many chocies we can make like whether we need to interpret or compile , 
do we need to make it platform agnostic by providing virtual machine, do we need to make a language format sensitive. 
When such choices are made we have many programming languages. This answers a very curios question "Why do we so many programming languages?"

<p> Just like any business decistion we need a extensive market research befor making a call. It makes sense to have awareness of pros and cons of a languge to make our call. 
With such goal in the backdrop this repo is a resource compiled from books/blogs/stackoverflow and to have a quick flavour of what Scala has to offer. </p>
